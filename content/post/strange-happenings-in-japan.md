# Strange Happenings in Japan: Translation from Taiwanese #1

I've been having fun learning a little Taiwanese lately. And because there are not that many materials around, I've been rummaging around online to find some older texts that I can translate.

This is largely for my own entertainment. The text here comes form the [Digital Archive Database for Wirtten Taiwanese](http://ip194097.ntcu.edu.tw/nmtl/dadwt/pbk.asp). It is a story about fox spirits and swindlers in Japan, first published in January 1886 in the Tainan Prefectural Church Newspaper (台南府城教會報第7張， 1886年1月). It's kind of fun. 

I've posted the story in parts. Each part has the Taiwanese version in POJ romanisation, then in characters (which, as I read Mandarin fairly well, is helpful for me with picking my way through), then a rough translation with notes in brackets. There are a few passages where I was more guessing than translating. I relied heavily on [ChhoeTaigi](https://chhoe.taigi.info/) for translating the text.

Finally, at the end, I've put a full, clean translation.

I'm only about four months into studying Taiwanese, so this is rough and ready. But it's been fun and interesting to play with.

### From Tâi-lâm-hú-siâⁿ Kàu-hōe-pò tē-7-tiuⁿ, 1886 nî 1 go̍eh (台南府城教會報第7張， 1886年 1月)

> About 10 years ago, in a village in Japan, there was a man who went to stay (hioh) in a guesthouse, and there he ate well and stayed in comfort, asking somebody to come and play the flute, so he could drink wine and have a good time.

## Strange happenings in Japan (final version)

About ten years ago, in a village in Japan, a stranger went to stay in a guesthouse. He ate well, and stayed in comfort. He asked somebody to come and play the flute, and he drank wine and had a good time.

When he wanted to rest, he asked the innkeeper to wake him at eleven the next day. The innkeeper, in line with the man's request, went the next day to call him, and there he saw, coiling from out of the bed, the tail of a fox. He was struck with fear, and without a further thought, he fled, assuming that his guest was almost certainly a demon.

But then he thought to himself: he has asked me to wake him, so if I don't do so, I'm afraid I will be held to account, and he will blame me. So he had no alternative to to oncde again go into the room. And there he saw the guest sitting in bed, smoking.

The guest saw the innkeeper's astonishment, and so he asked him, "What have you come in here to see?"

At first the innkeeper didn't dare to speak. He could only make his excuses, saying, "Nothing! Nothing!"

But then the guest said, "You have certainly seen something, so you should tell me clearly, right away! So after that, the innkeeper told him honestly "I saw a fox's tail!"

The guest then replied, "Hm...mmmm, now you seen it, I might as well tell you the truth. I am really an old fox, and I usually stay in the mountains; but at the moment, I'm here on business.

Everything you have seen and heard — all of this, you absolutely must keep quiet about! But if you really do this, then whenever you give money to the temple, I will give you double.

Having said this, he got up to leave, and didn't even give half a cent in expenses to the innkeeper. The innkepper also didn't dare detain him. The next day, the innkeeper gave fifty coins to the temple, to see what would happen. The day after that, he found of that the money had changed into one hundred coins. .

For the next few days, the same happened as before, so the innkeper lost all his scepticism. But then his heart turned to greed. So he gathered together 100 coins, and offered those to the temple. When he went to check the next day, not only had the money not increased, but all the money had had put in had gone. Nevertheless, the innkeeper didn't lose hope. He tried again, going to checkthe next day, and still there was nothing... 

From that moment on, he knew he had been fooled by a swindler. In reality, this person was not a fox. Instead, he was somebody who knew how much people valued this kind of superstition, and who sought out their weaknesses so he could defraud them.
