Hi. I'm Dr Will Buckingham, and this is my ongoing notebook.

I write books, teach in various places (I'm on the faculty at Parami University, Myanmar), and run all kinds of intruiging projects.

My most recent book is *Hello, Stranger: Stories of Connection in a Divided World* (Granta 2021/2).

The best place to find out about my work is by going to some of the following:

- [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com)
- My [personal website](https://www.willbuckingham.com)
- [Looking for Wisdom](https://www.lookingforwisdom.com), my ongoing philosophy project
- [Wind&Bones](https://www.windandbones.com), the social enterprise I co-direct
